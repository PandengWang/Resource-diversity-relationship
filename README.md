# Resource-diversity relationship
 
We used the R package DADA2 to obtain the amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) following the workflow described in Callahan et al. Taxonomic identities were assigned to ASVs using the SILVA version 132 database. To generate tese data use ".rmd".

The phylogenetic tree (Extended Data Fig. 2) was reconstructed using Randomized Axelerated Maximum Likelihood (RAxML) using default parameters.
